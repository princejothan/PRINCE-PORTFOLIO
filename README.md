# About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Prince Jothan, a passionate graphic designer with over 5 years of experience specializing in branding, digital marketing, and illustration. I believe that great design tells a story. My goal is to create visually compelling designs that not only look good but also communicate effectively and resonate with audiences.

I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, and CorelDRAW and I have a strong foundation in typography, color theory, and layout design. With experience working with diverse clients, from startups to established brands, I have created successful designs that have increased engagement and brand visibility.
