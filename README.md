### About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Prince Jothan, a passionate graphic designer with over 5 years of experience specializing in branding, digital marketing, and illustration. I believe that great design tells a story. My goal is to create visually compelling designs that not only look good but also communicate effectively and resonate with audiences.

I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, and CorelDRAW and I have a strong foundation in typography, color theory, and layout design. With experience working with diverse clients, from startups to established brands, I have created successful designs that have increased engagement and brand visibility.

### GRAPHIC DESIGNS WITH ADOBE PHOTOSHOP
As a graphic designer, I utilize Adobe Photoshop for its unparalleled capabilities in image manipulation and graphic design. This tool empowers me to create visually compelling designs that captivate audiences.

In a recent project for Awalife 9ja, Awanneds and Ikkonect I enhanced product images for a marketing campaign, resulting in a significant boost in customer engagement. My design workflow typically includes:

- Importing images and organizing layers for clarity.
- Retouching and editing to achieve the desired look and feel.
- Integrating text and graphics to create cohesive designs.
- Finalizing and exporting files for both print and digital platforms.
Photoshop has been instrumental in delivering high-quality results for my clients.
