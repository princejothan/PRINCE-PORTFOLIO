## ABOUT ME
Hi, Iâ€™m Prince Jothan, a passionate graphic designer with over 7 years of experience specializing in branding, digital marketing, and illustration. I believe that great design tells a story.

## GRAPHIC DESIGNS WITH ADOBE PHOTOSHOP
As a graphic designer, I utilize Adobe Photoshop for its unparalleled capabilities in image manipulation and graphic design. This tool empowers me to create visually compelling designs that captivate audiences.

In a recent project for Awalife 9ja, Awanneds and Ikkonect I enhanced product images for a marketing campaign, resulting in a significant boost in customer engagement. My design workflow typically includes:

- Importing images and organizing layers for clarity.
- Retouching and editing to achieve the desired look and feel.
- Integrating text and graphics to create cohesive designs.
- Finalizing and exporting files for both print and digital platforms.
Photoshop has been instrumental in delivering high-quality results for my clients. 

Explore my designs to see how I can help bring your vision to life!

## GRAPHIC DESIGNS WITH COREL DRAW

As a graphic designer, I leverage CorelDRAW for its exceptional capabilities in vector graphic design. This tool enables me to produce high-quality, scalable graphics that are essential for creating flyers, illustrations, and marketing materials.

In a recent project for Elite Solar, I created a design that not only captured the essence of their brand but also increased their visibility in the market. My design workflow includes:

- Initial concept sketches
- Vectorizing and refining designs with precision
- Applying color schemes that resonate with the target audience
- Preparing final designs for print and digital formats
  
CorelDRAW has been instrumental in achieving impactful results for my clients, and I look forward to bringing your ideas to life. Check out my designs below!
